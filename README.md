# Machine-learning_binary-classification_books-popularity

We build a binary classification model using a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether a book is popular or unpopular. We aim to achieve a model accuracy of at least 70%. 

The dataset includes the following features:

• price
• review/summary
• review/text
• review/helpfulness
• authors
• categories
• popularity (target variable)
